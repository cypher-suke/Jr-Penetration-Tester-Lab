# Room 1 - **Walking an Application:** Manually Reviewing a Web Application for Security Issues Using Browser Developer Tools

In this lab, I developed skills to manually review a website/application using built-in browser developer tools to identify potential security issues. This hands-on approach is essential for understanding the fundamentals of web application security.

## Page Source

The first tool I utilized was the "View Page Source" feature, which is accessible in any modern web browser, typically found under the "More Tools" section in the browser's settings.

**View Page Source** is an invaluable tool for penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. It allows for an in-depth analysis of a website's underlying structure by displaying the raw HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript code that constitutes the webpage.

### How I Applied My Analytical and Forensic Skills

1. **Code Review and Analysis**:
   - **Comments in Code**: By examining the comments within the code, I gained insights into the developer's thought process and the functionality of various elements. This can sometimes reveal critical information about the application's logic and potential security flaws.
   - **Hidden Directories and Sensitive Information**: I identified any hidden directories or files that could expose sensitive information. This is crucial for ensuring site confidentiality and protecting against unauthorized access.
   - **Configuration Checks**: I reviewed configurations to ensure they are correctly set up to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive webpages or files. Proper configuration is a key element in maintaining the security posture of an application.

2. **Frameworks and Patch Management**:
   - **Version Verification**: By checking the versions of frameworks and libraries used, I ensured that the website is running the most up-to-date versions, reducing the risk of exploitation from known vulnerabilities. Keeping software updated is a fundamental practice in mitigating security risks.

## Key Skills Highlighted

- **Attention to Detail**: My ability to meticulously review and analyze the source code for potential security issues demonstrates a high level of attention to detail.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Evaluating code comments, configurations, and versions of frameworks requires strong analytical skills to understand the security implications.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Identifying hidden directories and understanding their potential security impact showcases my forensic investigation abilities.
- **Technical Proficiency**: Proficiency with browser developer tools and understanding web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are essential skills for any cybersecurity professional.

By mastering the use of the "View Page Source" tool, I have developed a solid foundation in web application security, preparing me to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities effectively.
